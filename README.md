## Redux Counter Lab
using redux create counter it should be able to `increment`, `decrement` and `reset`
* Install redux using npm install
* Import redux
* Create redux store
* Create actions for increment, decrement and reset
* Create reducer `counter` that will return the counter+1 or counter-1 or counter=0 based on the action you send
* Create dispatch that send the actions to the reducer (using useDispatch)
* Using useSelector return the counter state
* Create three buttons for (increment, decrement and reset) when clicking button it should dispatch an action
* Display the value of the counter from the state
